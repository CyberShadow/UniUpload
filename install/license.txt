UniUpload v1.38
© 2005-2010 Vladimir Panteleev <thecybershadow@gmail.com>

*** Usage ***
After installation, you can upload files by right-clicking on 
them in Windows Explorer and selecting "Upload to ...".
This also works when you select multiple files.
UniUpload supports uploading files to ImageShack.us (images only), 
MediaFire.com, and to a custom script for your own webspace (see below).
More public upload providers (like RapidShare.com) may be added in 
the future.

Information about all completed uploads will be logged to
the file "My uploads.txt" in your "My Documents" folder.

*** Screenshot upload ***
Since 1.1, you can upload the current image in your clipboard.
How to use:

First of all, create a shortcut on your desktop/quick-launch/whatever
pointing to:
UniUpld.exe ImageShack Clipboard

Whenever you want to upload a screenshot, first press [Print screen]
to copy your desktop image to the clipboard, then open that shortcut.
You can bind it to a hotkey (like Win+PrintScreen) using your shell 
or something like AutoHotKey.
Uploaded screenshots are saved to My Documents\My Pictures\Uploaded 
pictures.

*** Text snippet upload ***
New in v1.3!
Need to share a sizeable piece of text with someone? No more pastebins!
You can now upload the text in your clipboard with UniUpload, the same
way you upload screenshots. Just run "UniUpload <UploadProvider> 
Clipboard" and UniUpload will upload a text file containing whatever
text you have in your clipboard. These snippets are saved to your "My 
Documents\Uploaded snippets" folder.

*** Upload to your account ***
New in v1.3!
If you have an account on ImageShack or MediaFire, you can now upload
directly to your account. All you have to do is to log in to your 
account with Microsoft Internet Explorer - UniUpload will now import
IE's cookies when uploading files.

*** Custom upload scripts ***
If you'd like to upload files to your webspace, follow these steps:

1) Create an upload script with a secret URL. The only 
   aunthentification is the URL, so keep it secure (remember to turn 
   off directory listings).
   The script should accept a file from an HTTP form with a file 
   upload field named "uploaded". The script's only output should be 
   either an error message, or a full URL (incl. http://) to the 
   uploaded file's location.

   Here's an example PHP upload script:

==== 8< =============================
<?php 
// In this example, the script is situated on http://www.example.com/uploaded/your_secret_upload_script_file_name.php

$target = basename( $_FILES['uploaded']['name']); 

// You can add file extension checks here - for example, prohibit uploading .php files

$md5 = md5_file($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name']);    // calculate the file's MD5 checksum
if(!file_exists($md5)) mkdir($md5);                  // create a folder for this file
if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name'], $md5 . "/" . $target)) 
  echo "http://www.example.com/uploaded/$md5/".rawurlencode($target);   // return the full URL to the uploaded file
else 
  echo "Sorry, there was a problem uploading your file."; 
?>
============================= >8 ====

2) Add the URL as a custom registry setting.
   The custom upload providers are stored in the 
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\UniUpload key, as REG_SZ (string) 
   values, named "Custom#" - where # is the provider's number, 
   starting from 0. Here's an example registry script:

==== 8< =============================
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\UniUpload]
"Custom0"="http://www.example.com/secret_upload_script.php"
============================= >8 ====

   After adding the custom upload script to the registry, an "Upload to
   www.example.com" item should appear in the right-click menu of all files.
   To upload clipboard content, use the domain name (e.g. "www.example.com") 
   as the upload provider, for example: 
     UniUpld.exe www.example.com Clipboard

   WARNING: If someone will find the address of your upload script, 
   they will be able to upload any content to your web space - including 
   executable scripts, unless you took precautions. I strongly recommend 
   giving the upload script a long and cryptic filename. You should guard 
   your registry settings as well, since they allow uploading random 
   content to your web site.

You can also "upload" to a local HTTP/FTP server, by making UniUpload 
copy the file to the relevant folder, and return an external link. This
allows sharing files quickly if you have an HTTP or FTP server running. To
do that, add a custom upload provider in the following format:

    Name|C:\Full\Path\To\Your\Local\Folder|http://your.ip.or.hostname/path/to/remote/folder/

Example registry script:

==== 8< =============================
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\UniUpload]
"Custom0"="HomeFTP|C:\\FTP\\pub\\Requested\\|ftp://127.0.0.1/pub/Requested/"
============================= >8 ====

Thus, when you select "Upload to HomeFTP", UniUpload will copy the file
to C:\FTP\pub\Requested\ and give you a link via your FTP.
